# machine_learning_tutorials
A collection of interactive notebooks demostrating fundamental machine learning principles.

This repository is a collection of jupyter notebooks. Each notebook demonstrates a few fundamental principles of machine learning. 

The notebooks and a summary of their content are:

1. time_series_classification [google colaboratory link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OuAkvtsEOHyNqkC1-K2WB85AOsFshVhA#scrollTo=4a40a2e5) - We first make synthetic time series data from sine wave and combination of sine waves. Then we build a classifier using this data. We experiment with fully connected layers and temporal convolutional layers.
